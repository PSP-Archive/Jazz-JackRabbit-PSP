Use 1.5 version. Make sure you put in the wav& s3m music files and the files from the original game ditribution.

NOTE: If you don't have the full version, you can save space on your ms by removing unnesessary s3m files: 
you only need ones with the same names as PSM files in the distribution. 
(for example: leave MENUSNG.S3M if you have MENUSNG.PSM). 
To save more space you can remove EXE & PSM files.


Sound FX support is still minimal: jump, shoot and get item events are linked to the wav files (jump.wav, shot.wav..)
If you have the original/better samples overwrite these files
